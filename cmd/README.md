# cmd

Go programs, built into the `agent-tools` image (`images/agent-tools/Dockerfile`). Tests: `go test -race ./...`.

## signal-shim

Serves the subset of signal-cli's HTTP daemon API that the Hermes Signal adapter uses (`GET /api/v1/check`, `GET /api/v1/events` as SSE, `POST /api/v1/rpc`) and translates it to signal-cli-rest-api in json-rpc mode.

`send` keeps the adapter's formatting: the `textStyle`/`textStyles` ranges (bold, italic, strikethrough, monospace, spoiler) become signal-cli-rest-api's `text_mode: "styled"` markers, with literal `*`, `` ` ``, `~` and `|` escaped. A range the styled parser can't express is dropped and its text sent unstyled: ranges that cross, a style overlapping itself, or a marker directly after a literal `\`.

Polls: `sendPollCreate` (`question`, `options`, a `groupId` or one `recipient`) and `sendPollTerminate` (`pollTimestamp`) map to `/v1/polls`. Without an `account`, the shim uses the only registered account. The adapter reads only a message's text, so the shim gives a vote on the event stream a text of its own: `🗳️ Poll "<question>": <options> (poll <timestamp>)`. It remembers the last 256 polls it created to name the options; after a restart it falls back to option numbers. Hermes sends polls with `signal-poll` (`images/hermes/bin/signal-poll`).
